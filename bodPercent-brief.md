## Dissolved Oxygen 

Dissolved oxygen is a fundamental component that allows fish and macroinvertebrates to survive in water. It is simply oxygen that is in a form that mixes in with water. According to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM), water should contain dissolved oxygen levels between 4 and 12 milligrams per liter to support aquatic life. Levels outside of that range may not be healthy enough to support aquatic life.
